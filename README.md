# Compatibility
Macos 26 beta 1 - beta 3: everything works fine
Macos 26 beta 4: spotlight doesn't work
MacÄ±s 26 beta 5 (and probably onwards): Dock, spotlight and launchpad doesn't work


# Update
This terminal command also has the same effect and doesn't require disabling SIP, however you will lose the new Spotlight.

``` 
sudo mkdir -p /Library/Preferences/FeatureFlags/Domain
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/FeatureFlags/Domain/SpotlightUI.plist SpotlightPlus -dict Enabled -bool false
```

after running these reboot

# Info 
Hooks a feature flag to bring back old launchpad

# Requirements
-arm64e-preview-abi=1 or amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 boot args (which also means disabled SIP and reduced/permissive security)

having the file /Library/TweakInject/libEllekit.dylib 

https://github.com/doraorak/Dylinject

# Usage 
inject the dylib to dock

# Building using Theos

`make clean package`

# Limitations
clicking launchpad icon again doesn't exit launchpad.
FIX: Go into the applications folder and replace Apps.app with the original Launchpad.app

(terminal command doesn't seem to have this issue)
